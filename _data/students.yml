  description: I am a master student at Montclair State University. After working at Amazon, a 
                I was eager to join the Data Science Lab and understand public
               reception to neuro innovation. My contributions to our Neuroethics Survey Project seek to outline how race,
               ethnicty, and rurality influence beliefs about therapeutic implanated neural devices. Previously, I've explored 
               social cognition, dementia, and I hope to pursue further research in neural interfaces at MSU.
