> Dr. Hao Liu is an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Montclair State University. His research focuses on health informatics, with a particular emphasis on natural language processing, knowledge representation, and data mining in the biomedical domain. Dr. Liu's work has been published in leading health informatics journals such as the Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA) and the Journal of Biomedical Informatics (JBI). His research aims to improve the quality and accessibility of clinical trial information, support evidence-based medicine, and enhance clinical decision-making through advanced informatics techniques.

Clinical trial informatics: Dr. Liu researched in the field of clinical trial informatics. His work includes the development of a knowledge base of clinical trial eligibility criteria (JBI, 2021), ontology-based categorization of clinical studies by their conditions (JBI, 2022), and a framework for assessing clinical trial population representativeness using electronic health records data (ACI, 2021). These studies aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of clinical trial design, recruitment, and evidence synthesis.

Natural language processing for biomedical ontologies: Dr. Liu has developed novel methods for using deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks and transformer models, to support the maintenance and enrichment of biomedical ontologies. His work has focused on SNOMED CT (AMIA, 2018; AMIA, 2019; JBI, 2020) and the National Cancer Institute Thesaurus (ICBO, 2018), demonstrating the potential of machine learning to enhance the quality and coverage of these critical knowledge resources.

COVID-19 research: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Dr. Liu has collaborated on several projects aimed at leveraging informatics to support clinical and public health efforts. These include the development of the COVID-19 Trial Finder (JAMIA, 2021), a data-driven approach to optimizing clinical study eligibility criteria for COVID-19 trials (JAMIA, 2021), and an analysis of the misalignment between COVID-19 hotspots and clinical trial sites (JAMIA, 2021).
